Purpose: This program generates 2D graphics 
of 3 images of letters T,Square,P
rotate 55 counter clockwise and 75 clockwise. 

I created three simple images of my choice: two letters (T and P) and one shape (Square) between them. Each image has a size of 25x25 pixels in two different colors (Green and Blue) and uses transformation methods to translate, rotate, and scale each of the letters and the shape as mentioned in instructions. When executing this program, it starts with frame 0. It starts at this position before any animation is conducted. Then, images shifted to the left -5 pixels in the x-direction in frame 1, and move up +7 pixels in the y-direction in frame 2. At frame 3 rotates at 45 degree (Rotates each image counterclockwise), and then, rotates each image 90 degrees clockwise in Frame 4. Frame 5 gets longer and the images get thinner in frame 6 (final transformation).
